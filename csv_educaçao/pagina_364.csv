The Nicest Thing - Lyrics: A music by Kate Nash - UOL Educação,Data não encontrada,"All I know is that you're so niceYou're the nicest thing I've seenI wish that we could give it a goSee if we could be somethingI wish I was your favourite girlI wish you thought I was the reason you are in the worldI wish my smile was your favourite kind of smileI wish the way that I dressed was your favourite kind of styleI wish you couldn't figure me outBut you always wanna know what I was aboutI wish you'd hold my handWhen I was upsetI wish you'd never forgetThe look on my face when we first metI wish you had a favourite beauty spotThat you loved secretly'Cause it was on a hidden bitThat nobody else could seeBasically, I wish that you loved meI wish that you needed meI wish that you knew when I said two sugars,Actually I meant threeI wish that without me your heart would break ID: {{comments.info.id}}URL:{{comments.info.url}}  tarde.
